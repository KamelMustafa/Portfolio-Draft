## 📱 Responsive Design

This site adapts seamlessly across devices using media queries and flexible layouts. The mobile menu is toggled via JavaScript, and sections stack vertically for optimal readability.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “I believe great frontend work is as much about clarity as it is about craft.”

Every detail—from typography to scroll behavior—is intentional. I strive to build interfaces that not only function flawlessly but leave a lasting visual impression.
